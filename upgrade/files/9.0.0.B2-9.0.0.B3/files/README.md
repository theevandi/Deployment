#UNA (United Networking Applications) - [https://una.io](https://una.io)

UNA is a **C**MS - **Community** Management System. It is not just one thing or one application. UNA is a combination of various web applications, databases, server apps and supporting ecosystem, which together enable you to create a community website. 

An online community powered by UNA can work as a social network, business collaboration hub or any kind of multi-user system with various memberships, roles, content types and permissions defining the rules of the community operation.  

While inherently designed as a multi-user community platform, UNA can be used as a conventional CMS or blogging platform with a focus on content publishing. The full potential, however, lies in networking. Social networking, business networking or even networking with Internet-connected devices.
